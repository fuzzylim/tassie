Well worth a visit on this route, Maria Island is home to the remains of the first convict settlement, as well as the beautiful Painted Cliffs and Fossil Cliffs. There are various accommodation options on the mainland, which make getting to Maria Island easier to reach for a day trip, including, Freycinet Lodge Retreat, and Rocky Hills Retreat among others. From Maria Island, drive to the Freycinet Peninsula to lap up the renowned coastal scenery. When approaching Swansea, look out for Spiky Bridge built by convicts. In Swansea, take a look at Australia’s only restored black wattle bark mill, and try the local cool-climate wines. While in the area, head to Coles Bay to sample local oysters, and hike the trail to famous Wineglass Bay. If you have time, visit Spring Vale Vineyard just north of Swansea.

## 2. 5 night east cost drive, South to North
### Hobart > Orford > Coles Bay > St Helens (308KM)
Orford has some of the most spectacular beaches and coastal, clifftop and forest walks in the area. If you’re stopping here, catch a 30 minute ferry over to Maria Island, the up and coming underdog challenging popular Bruny Island further south. Enjoy the natural wildlife, historic ruins and spectacular Painted Cliffs and Fossil Cliffs. Back on the mainland, further north lies Coles Bay, at the entrance to the renowned, picturesque Freycinet Peninsula. On the way to Coles, pass through the seaside town of Swansea for some lunch, and take a look at the local wineries. If you’re still in the mood for local delights, head to Melshell Oyster Shack in Dolphin Sands. Or if you’d like to sample the local oysters in Coles Bay itself, head to Freycinet Marine Farm. Before heading off north to St Helens, see nearby famous Wineglass Bay.

### St Helens > Derby > Bridport > Launceston (198KM) Windy!
St Helens, a picturesque fishing town on Georges Bay inlet, is a fisherman’s dream. With boat hire available, family fishing is common in the estuaries, rivers and bays. The region is known for tin mining, it’s Chinese and Aboriginal heritage, white beaches and nearby walking trails. On route to Derby, drop in toPyengana Cheese for its high quality, ethically sourced produce. And to St Columba Falls for one of Tasmania’s highest multi-tiered waterfalls.

Further north, the small riverside country town of Derby was settled in 1874, and is known for its tin mining, world-class mountain biking track and the Blue Derby Pods ride. On the northern coast of the island lies the pretty coastal town of Bridport which is known for salt water fishing, Wildflower Reserve and walking trails.
